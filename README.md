# Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementations of code for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Laboratory component 

1. **File I/O, Pointers, Linked Lists,** Implementation of Last-In-First-Out (Stack) data structure using a linked list
2. **Sequential List:** Insertion, comparator implementation

3. **Abstract Data Type**, Linked Lists, Measuring Run Time
4. .**Runtime Memory Layout and Heap Allocation,** Linked Lists, Measuring Running Time
   and Space Usage
5.  **Recursion, Measurements**: Running Time and Space Usage, Insertion Sorting, File
   I/O, and Build Tool - Makefile
6. **Recursion vs. Iteration** - Running Time and Space Usage, File I/O and Sorting Large
   data (Merge sort implementation)
7. **Quick Sort, Performance Measurement**s - Running Time and Space Usage, Command
   Line Arguments (implementation with and without a bisection, curve fitting for time matching)
8. **Hash tables**: Creation and Querying along with performance analysis (Hash function identification, profiling and optimizing hash table for an input domain)
